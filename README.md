### Overview
- The second project which I have made during the Code Institute course. It was a walkthrough miniproject that contained two parts. 
    - First part was a culmination of material introduced on the User Centric Frondend Development module including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4. 
    - The second part was a culmination of material introduced on Interactive Frontend Development using Java Script and jQuery to manipulate the DOM and to make Ajax calls to the Google Maps, GitHub and email service API's. Two pages: Interests and Github were added to the previously created project and also a custom map using the Google Maps API, link an email service to receive an email, when somebody fills out the correct form using EmailJS.
- By building the Resume website I gained a better understanding of how to the Front End Development works.

### The purpose of the website
- The aim of this project was to use the tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Java Script, jQuery, Google Maps, EmailJS to create a full responsive Resume website for Rosie Odenkirk a Full Stack Web Developer where the user can send Email, find other users Github Repository, Read the Map localisation where Rosie was attended on the conferences. 
- The website contains five separate pages, a Home page, a Resume page, a Contact page, Interests page, GitHub Page and also a pdf format CV that can downloaded. 
- The **Home** page has "Personal Info" and an "About me" section. The "About me" section provides information about Rosie. 
- The **Resume** page includes "Work History" using time-line item bullet points and "My Skills" progress bar sections which shows the level of advancement of Rosie's programming languages.
